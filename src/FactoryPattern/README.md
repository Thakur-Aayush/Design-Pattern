Factory Pattern
================================

* Factory method is used when we have a parent class and multiple sub-classes
* Based on the input we need to return one of the sub-class.
* Factory Pattern takes out the responsibility if object creation from client side to the factory class.
* Its one of the **Creational Design Pattern**
* Its widely used in frameworks like **Spring** and **Struts**


#####Advantages
* It provides an approach to code for interfaces rather than implementation.
* It removes instantiation of actual implementation of classes from client side.
* It makes our code robust, less coupled and east to extend.
* Factory pattern provides abstraction between implementation and client class through inheritance.
